## Overview

This is the 6th place solution for [episode 11 of the third season of the Tabular Playground Series](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e10/overview). The TPS competitions often have a smaller dataset than it's monetary cousins to make it more accessible, but they also include some theme or challenge unique to the competition that competitors must figure out. The challenge to overcome in this episode was nonlinearity. My final model was an ensemble of a Generalized Additive Model and various forest models.
